#This is a list of top ten bangers by genre.

#It pulls the list from a respository I created and uses Spring/MVC to display it on the web via HTML templates in the templates directory.

##I also added playable song links via iframe and Spotify. I entered spotify's URI as a variable in the repository and then staticly coded the link to the iframe spotify player inserting the correct URI depending on the song.
